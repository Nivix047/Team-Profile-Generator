# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The team profile generator generates profile cards from the perspective of the manager. When initiated, a series of questions are asked and profile cards are generated based on the answers provided by the manager. The main focus of this project was to use the testing framework Jest to ensure quality before deployment. Additionally, OOP methods such as constructors were applied which allows projects to be more DRY and organized.
